# rakuten-scraper

- this was done on rails lib/tasks with some models (but you can modify it easily, the original model info is provided)
- how to web-scrape in general and how to do it on a massive site like rakuten

#### Warning
- most sites in general do not want you to be web-scraping their information so add some "sleep delay times" to make the extraction seem for human-like. otherwise, you will get your ip banned.
